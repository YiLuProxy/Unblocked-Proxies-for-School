## Why are [unblocked proxies for school](https://yilu.us/proxies/unblocked-proxies-for-school-2022) important?
In today's era of the Internet revolution, people's need to find meaningful videos, movies, games, and TV shows to entertain themselves is more and more urgent. Although it may seem like a simple task, in fact, sometimes the network administrator at school or workplace restricts access to entertainment websites, which brings a lot of inconvenience to our entertainment life. There are many reasons why the school restricts access to certain websites, aiming at protecting the safety and privacy of students, controlling students' online behavior, complying with laws and policies, maintaining the reputation of the school, and ensuring the normal operation of the school. This limitation can leave us feeling lost and frustrated as we cannot easily access our favorite websites.  

Despite the inconvenience posed by limitations on accessing entertainment websites, there are remedies to resolve this issue. One feasible tactic is to look for alternative websites that are unrestricted. While this may require some effort in research, it can produce satisfactory outcomes. There are a plethora of websites that provide comparable content and are not blocked, and by exploring these options, we can discover those that best align with our preferences.  

An additional approach is to employ technological solutions like proxy servers and virtual private networks (VPNs). Proxy servers permit us to access a website indirectly, via a different server that is not restricted, thereby circumventing the limitation. Similarly, VPNs encrypt our internet traffic and direct it through a private server, which makes it arduous for network administrators to monitor or hinder our access to restricted sites. These tools enable us to access the entertainment content we desire, while simultaneously safeguarding our privacy and security.

## What unblocked proxies can do?
### 1. Unblock all websites.
Proxy sites assist users in circumventing restrictions imposed by network administrators on blocked websites. When users encounter a website that is blocked, they can resort to using a proxy server. The proxy server serves as a mediator that forwards the user's request to the target website, and subsequently returns the response to the user.  
By availing themselves of a proxy server, users can shield their genuine IP address. The network administrator can solely observe the IP address of the proxy server, and is unable to identify the user's authentic IP address. As such, the administrator cannot detect that the user is attempting to visit a restricted website, and is precluded from imposing any restrictions or blocking the user.

### 2. Support video platforms.
A browser web proxy is a handy tool that enables you to access video sites that may be blocked by network administrators. By setting up a proxy server, you can browse video sites through the proxy server and access restricted video content. Moreover, the browser network proxy also supports video playback, which means that videos can be preloaded and cached while you are browsing. This feature contributes to faster video loading and a better viewing experience. Consequently, using a browser web proxy can help you access and watch video content with ease.

### 3. Protect privacy and browsing history.
vEmploying a proxy server is an effective way to safeguard your online privacy and browsing history. specifically, when you access a website through a proxy server, your actual IP address is concealed and replaced by the IP address of the proxy server. Consequently, it becomes extremely difficult for any website to track your identity and location. Moreover, a proxy server also encrypts your internet traffic, thus providing an additional layer of protection to your online privacy and security. Especially when using a public Wi-Fi network, using a proxy server can help you guard against potential hacking attempts and identity theft. By incorporating a proxy server into your internet browsing, you can ensure a safer and more secure online experience, and better protect your sensitive personal information.
